The FIC group, partenered with JHU/JHUAPL, has hosted several workshops (both virtual and on-site) since 2019. These tutorials are available through a private url provided by the instructors on enrolmment in one or more courses. To receive more information or attempt to enroll please reach out to brian.merritt@jhuapl.edu.


These tutorials are privately kept within a Docker image for offline use directly within basestack. To access this module you need the aws key that accompanies the google drive provided for each workshop. If you need access to this file and are a participant of the workshops please email one of the instructors. 


Once you have the key downloaded, simply input it within the install modules tab (select the cog icon for configuration). If you have access to the offline image: basestack_tutorial.tar.gz, simply select "Offline" and input the COMPRESSED (.tar.gz ) file into the input field
