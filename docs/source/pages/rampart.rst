Rampart is an annotation tool provided by the Artic Network that gives quick, but less accurate reports for each of your demuxed samples. It is ideal for a quick look into what the annotations for each of your barcodes are but should not be fully relied on, instead opt for the pipeline that was just discussed.

1. Ensure you've loaded a run that has been bookmarked from the previous tab (described above). 
2. Select one of the included primer-schemes from the drop-down list. For this example, the data is ncov-related so we will choose rampart-ncov-2019.
3. Select *Run Rampart* and wait a few seconds for the window to appear. If nothing appears, please hit *Refresh Rampart* and see if the window then appears. Only attempt this if a success message appears after running.
